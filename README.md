# Portfolio V2 (WIP)

Hola, weary traveller!

It seems you've stumbled upon the second iteration of my portfolio. I launched my first portfolio back in 2019 and since then have been trying to master my craft.

What I'm currently building here is hopefully a mosaic of all that I've learned since then (with some easter eggs stuffed in – no doubt).

The elevator pitch for this portfolio is as follows: You interview me – right here and now from your browser!

In a nutshell, I will take the plunge and index my entire being into a vector database (Remember that Black Mirror episode ?!). With that in place, I will use a combination LLMs and TTS services to "speak" with you and answer any questions you may have!

### Getting Started

#### Install Dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

#### Start the application
