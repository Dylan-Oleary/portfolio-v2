# Portfolio V2 (WIP)

Hola, weary traveller!

It seems you've stumbled upon the second iteration of my portfolio. I launched my first portfolio back in 2019 and since then have been trying to mastermy craft.

What I'm currently building here is hopefully a mosaic of all that I've learned since then (with a some easter eggs stuffed in – no doubt).

The elevator pitch for this portfolio is as follows: You interview me – right here and now from your browser!
